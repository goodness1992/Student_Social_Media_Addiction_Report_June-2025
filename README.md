 ### Project Overview
 --------

This project analyzes how social media usage affects students' academic performance, sleep patterns, mental health, and daily habits across different countries, age groups, and academic levels.
I used Microsoft Excel 365 to build a dynamic and interactive dashboard that visualizes insights using Pivot Tables, slicers, charts, and conditional formatting.

### Tools Used

•	Microsoft Excel 365
•	Pivot Tables (for summarizing and grouping data)
•	Charts & Graphs (bar, pie, and line charts for visual insights)
•	Slicers (to filter data by country and platform)
•	Data Cleaning (within Excel)

### Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries

Standardized formats (e.g., date, academic level labels)

Used Excel formulas (e.g., IF, TEXT, TRIM, LEFT/RIGHT) for data transformation

Handled missing values by imputing where logical or removing if incomplete

Created calculated fields for metrics such as average usage, addiction score, and mental health index

Grouped values using Pivot Table Grouping (e.g., by age range and academic level)

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed average usage by academic level, age, and gender

Examined social media platform usage trends

Identified conflict frequency by platform

Investigated relationships between social media usage and academic/mental health performance

Segmented data using Pivot Tables and slicers for deeper pattern discovery

Visualized findings through charts: bar graphs, line charts, pie charts, and maps

### Key Findings

Instagram and TikTok are the most used and most conflict-associated platforms

Undergraduates show the highest daily average usage (1.76 hrs), while high school students have the lowest

Increased social media use is linked to reduced sleep hours and lower mental health scores

Conflict frequency and addiction scores are higher for frequent users

The gender distribution of daily usage is almost equal (Female: 51%, Male: 49%)

###  Recommendations

Digital wellness education should be introduced to students at all academic levels

Institutions can encourage screen time management tools and app usage limits

Promote mental health programs to address the stress linked with high social media exposure

Schools can include social media literacy in the curriculum to help students balance usage

Encourage break periods or “social detox” weeks for healthier habits
